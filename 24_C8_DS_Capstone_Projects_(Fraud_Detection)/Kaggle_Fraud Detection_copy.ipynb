    "Fraud that involves cell phones, insurance claims, tax return claims, credit card transactions, government procurement etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses and specialized analysis techniques for discovering fraud using them are required.

    "In general, the primary reason to use data analytics techniques is to tackle fraud since many internal control systems have serious weaknesses. For example, the currently prevailing approach employed by many law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of fraud cases remain undetected and unprosecuted. In order to effectively test, detect, validate, correct error and monitor control systems against fraudulent activities, businesses entities and organizations rely on specialized data analytics techniques such as data mining, data matching, sounds like function, Regression analysis, Clustering analysis and Gap. Techniques used for fraud detection fall into two primary classes: statistical techniques and artificial intelligence.\n",

    "This dataset is severely **unbalanced** (most of the transactions are non-fraud). So the algorithms are much more likely to classify new observations to the majority class and high accuracy won't tell us anything. To address the problem of imbalanced dataset we can use undersampling and oversampling data approach techniques. Oversampling increases the number of minority class members in the training set. The advantage of oversampling is that no information from the original training set is lost unlike in undersampling, as all observations from the minority and majority classes are kept. On the other hand, it is prone to overfitting. \n",

Before deploying the model, many things such as data storage, preprocessing, model building and monitoring need to be studied.\n",

Only when a model is fully integrated with the business systems, real values ​​can be extract from its predictions."
